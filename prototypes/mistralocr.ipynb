The January 28, 2024 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position, have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024.\\n\\n## Significant Accounting Policies\\n\\nThere have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024.\\n\\n## Fiscal Year\\n\\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2025 and 2024 are both 52-week years. The first quarters of fiscal years 2025 and 2024 were both 13-week quarters.\\n\\n## Principles of Consolidation\\n\\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\\n\\n## Use of Estimates\\n\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories and product purchase commitments, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, property, plant, and equipment, and other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.\\n\\n## Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\\n\\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\\n\\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued a new accounting standard to provide for additional disclosures about significant expenses in operating segments. The standard is effective for our annual reporting starting with fiscal year 2025 and for interim period reporting starting in fiscal year 2026 retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides for new and updated income tax disclosures, including disaggregation of rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied prospectively, with retrospective application permitted. We expect to adopt this standard in our annual reporting starting with fiscal year 2026. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\",\n",

Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was $13.9 \\\\%$ and $7.5 \\\\%$ for the first quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively.\\n\\nThe effective tax rate increased primarily due to a decreased effect of tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction and stock-based compensation relative to the increase in income before income tax.\\n\\nOur effective tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of $21 \\\\%$ due to tax benefits from stockbased compensation, the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, and the U.S. federal research tax credit.\\n\\nWhile we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position.

As of April 28, 2024, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.\\n\\n## Note 6 - Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\\n\\nOur cash equivalents and marketable securities related to publicly held debt securities are classified as \\\"available-for-sale\\\" debt securities.\\n\\nThe following is a summary of cash equivalents and marketable securities:\\n\\n|  | Apr 28, 2024 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\\n|  | Amortized Cost | Unrealized Gain | Unrealized Loss | Estimated Fair Value | Reported as |  |  |\\n|  |  |  |  |  | Cash Equivalents |  | Marketable Securities |\\n|  |  |  | (In millions) |  |  |  |  |\\n| Corporate debt securities | \\\\$ 11,397 | \\\\$ 3 | \\\\$ (43) | \\\\$ 11,357 | \\\\$ 733 | \\\\$ 10,624 |  |\\n| Debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury | 11,314 | \\u2014 | (62) | 11,252 | 886 | 10,366 |  |\\n| Money market funds | 5,374 | \\u2014 | \\u2014 | 5,374 | 5,374 |  | \\u2014 |\\n| Debt securities issued by U.S. government agencies | 2,826 | \\u2014 | (7) | 2,819 | 189 | 2,630 |  |\\n| Certificates of deposit | 286 | \\u2014 | \\u2014 | 286 | 69 | 217 |  |\\n| Foreign government bonds | 14 | \\u2014 | \\u2014 | 14 | \\u2014 | 14 |  |\\n| Total | \\\\$ 31,211 | \\\\$ 3 | \\\\$ (112) | \\\\$ 31,102 | \\\\$ 7,251 | \\\\$ 23,851 |  |\",\n",

The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA's motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court's dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in dismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA's petition for rehearing en banc of the Ninth Circuit panel's majority decision to reverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed on October 10, 2023. On November 21, 2023, NVIDIA filed a motion with the Ninth Circuit for a stay of the mandate pending NVIDIA's petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court's resolution of the matter. On December 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted NVIDIA's motion to stay the mandate. NVIDIA filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on March 4, 2024. Four amicus briefs in support of NVIDIA's petition were filed on April 5, 2024.\\n\\nThe putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs' appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but stated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The stay remains in place. The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA's corporate governance and internal procedures.\\n\\nThe putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs' appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures.\\n\\nAnother putative derivative action was filed on October 30, 2023 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned Horanic v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 2023-1096-KSJM). This lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty and insider trading based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and reform of unspecified corporate governance measures. This derivative matter is stayed pending the final resolution of In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action.\\n\\n## Accounting for Loss Contingencies\\n\\nAs of April 28, 2024, there are no accrued contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications. Our two operating segments are \\\"Compute \\\\& Networking\\\" and \\\"Graphics,\\\" as described in Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\n\\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\\n\\n## Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\\n\\n## Demand and Supply, Product Transitions, and New Products and Business Models\\n\\nOur overall revenue, driven by data center compute, continued to grow through the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. We continue to gather customer demand indications across several product transitions. We have demand visibility for our data center products, including the recently announced Blackwell GPU architecture. We have previously increased our supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers with planned receipts later this year. We continue to add new vendors and have entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products. The increased purchase volumes and number of suppliers and integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. Our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 continued to be impacted by shortening lead times for certain components. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines. While supply for H100 continued to improve, we are still constrained on H200. Our next generation data center architecture, Blackwell, is in production, and we plan on shipping customer samples in the second quarter. We expect to ramp customer shipments of Blackwell in the second half of the fiscal year. We believe the initial demand for Blackwell is well ahead of the projected supply for this fiscal year. We expect supply constraints for our Blackwell offerings will continue into next year.\\n\\nProduct transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center, Gaming, and Professional Visualization products. We have begun a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of\",\n",

The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can reduce or create volatility in our revenue. The increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in product delays. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs.\\n\\nWe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications such as our NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, our Omniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies, such as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term trajectory is unknown.\\n\\n# Global Trade \\n\\nIn August 2022, the U.S. government, or the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\\n\\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\\n\\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products. We have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.\\n\\nWe expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. We ramped new products designed specifically for China that do not require an export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China is down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of new export control restrictions in October 2023. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license, or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all.\\n\\nOur competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed in the long term, if there are further changes in the USG's export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East.\\n\\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to \\\"Item 1A. Risk Factors\\\" for a discussion of this potential impact.\\n\\n## Macroeconomic Factors\\n\\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints and global economic and geopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and quantify, these macroeconomic factors can also impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our investments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors.\",\n",

Our global supply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact. A substantial number of our employees in the region have been called-up for active military duty in Israel. Some of our employees in Israel have been on active military duty for an extended period and they or others may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. We have not experienced significant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is further extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our business.\\n\\n## First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2025 Summary\\n\\n|  | Three Months Ended |  |  |  | Quarter-over-Quarter Change | Year-over-Year Change |\\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\\n|  | Apr 28, 2024 | Jan 28, 2024 |  | Apr 30, 2023 |  |  |\\n|  | (\\\\$ in millions, except per share data) |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| Revenue | \\\\$ | 26,044 | \\\\$ | 22,103 | \\\\$ | 7,192 | $18 \\\\%$ | $262 \\\\%$ |\\n| Gross margin |  | $78.4 \\\\%$ |  | $76.0 \\\\%$ |  | $64.6 \\\\%$ | 2.4 pts | 13.8 pts |\\n| Operating expenses | \\\\$ | 3,497 | \\\\$ | 3,176 | \\\\$ | 2,508 | $10 \\\\%$ | $39 \\\\%$ |\\n| Operating income | \\\\$ | 16,909 | \\\\$ | 13,615 | \\\\$ | 2,140 | $24 \\\\%$ | $690 \\\\%$ |\\n| Net income | \\\\$ | 14,881 | \\\\$ | 12,285 | \\\\$ | 2,043 | $21 \\\\%$ | $628 \\\\%$ |\\n| Net income per diluted share | \\\\$ | 5.98 | \\\\$ | 4.93 | \\\\$ | 0.82 | $21 \\\\%$ | $629 \\\\%$ |\\n\\nWe specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications.

A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.\\n\\n## Part II.

This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results.\\n\\nWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into longterm supply agreements and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. Additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are not available from third parties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on orders for certain supply may be extended. We have previously experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scale their capabilities to meet our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity, which may require additional deposits. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines.\\n\\nMany additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers' future demand for our products, or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:\\n\\n- changes in product development cycles and time to market;\\n- competing technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions;\\n- changes in business and economic conditions;\\n- sudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues;\\n- rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\\n- the availability of sufficient data center capacity and energy for customers to procure;\\n- new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\\n- new or unexpected end-use cases;\\n- increase in demand for competitive products ;\\n- business decisions made by third parties;\\n- the demand for accelerated computing or Al-related cloud services;\\n- changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;\\n- the demand for our products; or\\n- government actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage.\\n\\nOur overall revenue, driven by data center compute, continued to grow through the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. We continue to gather customer demand indications across several product transitions. We have demand visibility for our data center products, including the recently announced Blackwell GPU architecture. We have previously increased our supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers with planned receipts later this year. We continue to add new vendors and have entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products. The increased purchase volumes and number of suppliers and integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. Our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 continued to be impacted by shortening lead times for certain components. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines. While supply for H100 continued to improve, we are still constrained on H200. Our next generation data center architecture, Blackwell, is in production, and we plan on shipping customer samples in the second quarter. We expect to ramp customer shipments of Blackwell in the second half of the fiscal year. We believe the initial demand for Blackwell is well ahead of the projected supply for this fiscal year. We expect supply constraints for our Blackwell offerings will continue into next year.\",\n",

      "            \"markdown\": \"Our customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in the past. Product transitions are complex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center, Gaming, and Professional Visualization products. We have begun a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to long manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can reduce or create volatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. The increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in product delays. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs.\\n\\nMany end customers often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by our multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to accurately forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties.\\n\\nIf we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. If our contract manufacturers experience supply constraints, we may not be able to increase supply to meet customer demand in a timely manner, or at all. If we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally, since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact.\\n\\nIf we overestimate our customers' future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers' increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future. We have also written down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments and may have to do so in the future. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\\n\\nWe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications, such as NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, NVIDIA AI Foundations, Omniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies, such as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our products may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand. Additionally, we started shipping our CPU product offerings, the Grace CPU and Grace Hopper Superchips, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our inability to accurately predict our CPU demand may create volatility in our revenue or supply levels.\\n\\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.\",\n",

For example, several years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0 merge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased aftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized \\\"gray market,\\\" which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels.\\n\\nAdditionally, we depend on developers, customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW. Failure by developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our platforms, or failure by third-party content providers or publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adversely affect customer demand.\\n\\n# International sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could harm our business. \\n\\nWe sell our products internationally, and we also have operations and conduct business internationally. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States, and we generated $48 \\\\%$ of our revenue during the first quarter in fiscal year 2025 from sales outside the United States. We have not received licenses from the USG to ship restricted products to China. We ramped new products designed specifically for China that do not require an export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China is down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of new export control restrictions in October 2023. We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These include domestic and international economic and political conditions in countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do business, government lockdowns to control case spread of global or local health issues, differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices, different domestic and international business and cultural practices, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies, currency fluctuations, natural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues and other catastrophic events.\\n\\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales to customers who purchase directly or indirectly from us, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\\n\\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. Sales to one direct customer, Customer A, and sales to another direct customer, Customer B, represented $13 \\\\%$ and $11 \\\\%$ of total revenue, respectively, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Both were attributable to the Compute \\\\& Networking segment. With several of these channel partners, we are selling multiple products and systems in our portfolio through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners' or customers' purchasing patterns. Many of our customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors and other channel partners. Two indirect customers each represented $10 \\\\%$ or more of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025; one of these indirect customers purchased our products primarily through direct Customer B. Both were attributable to the Compute \\\\& Networking segment. If end demand increases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amount of our revenue. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries' trade restrictions or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations.\",\n",

Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea and China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us regarding our business and competition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also received requests for information from regulators in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and China regarding our sales of GPUs, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, and we expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Governments and regulators are considering imposing restrictions on the hardware, software, and systems used to develop frontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act will likely become law this year. Restrictions under this and any other regulations, if implemented, could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of new systems using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\\n\\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce's U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\\n\\nFor example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.\\n\\nThe increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings.\\n\\nConcerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications, models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying, tuning, and deploying LLMs. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our business and financial results.\\n\\nSuch restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI technologies. As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of export control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral controls restricting GPUs and associated\",\n",

Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be further lightened, would further restrict our ability to export our technology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair, or transfer of our products, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and customers to provide services to their end customers, even outside China.\\n\\nExport controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside China and for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business.\\n\\nIncreasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges. Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our sales and efforts to supply the China market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. If the regulators conclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to various penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\\n\\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China's semiconductor and supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop, produce and manufacture certain chips to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in China. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\\n\\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products. We have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.\\n\\nFollowing these export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out of China and Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer. However, the licensing process is time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is offered, it may impose burdensome conditions that we or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG is evaluating license requests in a closed process that does not have clear standards or an opportunity for review. For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or \\\"NAC,\\\" process has not resulted in approvals for exports of products to customers in China. The license process for exports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions for countries outside China. The requirements have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and already have disadvantaged and may in the future\",\n",

Our competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if there are further changes in the USG's export controls, including further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.\\n\\nGiven the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USG has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, or by requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that would disable or impair GPUs if certain system or use conditions are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. In addition, as the performance of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export controls may have a greater impact on our ability to compete in markets subject to those controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions to \\\"design-out\\\" certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve markets worldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in other markets, such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls.\\n\\nAdditionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.\\n\\nFinally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan. Any new restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan, would negatively impact our business and financial results.\\n\\n# Item 2.

This Award is granted to you effective as of the date of grant set forth in the Grant Notice (the \\\"Date of Grant\\\"). Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Agreement will have the same meanings given to them in the Plan.\\n\\n1. Grant of the Award. The Award represents the right to be issued on a future date one share of Common Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit that vests under this Award, subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Agreement and in the Plan. As of the Date of Grant, the Company will credit to a bookkeeping account maintained by the Company for your benefit (the \\\"Account\\\") the number of Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you will not be required to make any payment to the Company with respect to your receipt of the Award, the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units or the delivery of the underlying Common Stock.\\n\\n## 2. Vesting.\\n\\n(a) Subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, your Award will vest, if at all, in accordance with the vesting schedule provided in the Grant Notice, including any special acceleration provisions, as applicable, contained in the Grant Notice.\\n(b) Vesting will cease upon the termination of your Continuous Service, except if such termination is due to your death, in which case vesting will accelerate as described in the Grant Notice (and subject to any other acceleration provided for in the Grant Notice or the Plan). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, if vesting accelerates as a result of the termination of your Continuous Service due to your death, such acceleration will occur on the date of your death (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter); provided, however, that: (i) such acceleration may be delayed until the date the Company receives written notification of your death from the executor or administrator of your estate (or your beneficiary, if applicable); (ii) the Company may require the executor or administrator of your estate (or your beneficiary, if applicable) to provide certain information to the Company (including, but not limited to, tax-related information), to the extent permissible under applicable law; and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any shares of Common Stock that are issuable as a result of such acceleration will be issued no later than the Issuance Deadline (as defined in Section 6(b) of this Agreement).\\n(c) On the termination of your Continuous Service (for any reason other than death), the Restricted Stock Units credited to the Account that were not vested on the date of such termination (and are not accelerated pursuant to any acceleration provided for in the Grant Notice or the Plan) will be forfeited and returned to the Company at no cost to the Company and you will have no further right, title or interest in or to such Restricted Stock Units or the underlying shares of Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, Continuous Service during only a period prior to a vesting date (but where Continuous Service has terminated prior to the vesting date) does not entitle you to vest in a pro-rata portion of the Restricted Stock Units on such date.\",\n",

Number of Restricted Stock Units and Shares of Common Stock. \\n\\n(a) The number of Restricted Stock Units (and the related shares of Common Stock) subject to your Award will be adjusted from time to time for Capitalization Adjustments, as provided in the Plan.\\n(b) Any Restricted Stock Units, shares, cash or other property that become subject to the Award as a result of a Capitalization Adjustment, if any, will be subject to the same forfeiture restrictions, restrictions on transferability, and time and manner of delivery as applicable to the other shares covered by your Award.\\n(c) No fractional shares or rights for fractional shares of Common Stock will be created by this Section 3. The Board will round down, to the nearest whole share or whole unit of rights, any fractional shares or rights for fractional shares.\\n4. Compliance with Law. You will not be issued any shares under your Award unless either (a) the shares are registered under the Securities Act; or (b) the Company has determined that such issuance would be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Your Award also must comply with other applicable laws and regulations governing the Award, including any U.S. and non-U.S. state, federal and local laws, and you will not receive such shares if the Company determines that such receipt would not be in material compliance with such laws and regulations.\\n5. Limitations on Transfer. Your Award is not transferable, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. In addition to any other limitation on transfer created by applicable securities or other laws, you agree not to assign, hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in any of the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award until the shares are issued to you. After the shares have been issued to you, you are free to assign, hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in such shares, provided that any such actions are in compliance with the provisions in this Agreement and applicable securities or other laws. If permitted by the Board and valid under applicable law, you may, by delivering written notice to the Company's designated broker, pursuant to a form provided by such broker, designate a third party who, in the event of your death, will thereafter be entitled to receive any distribution of Common Stock to which you were entitled at the time of your death pursuant to this Agreement.\\n\\n## 6. Date of Issuance.\\n\\n(a) The issuance of shares of Common Stock in respect of the Restricted Stock Units is intended to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and will be construed and administered in such a manner to the extent applicable. The form of such issuance (e.g., a stock certificate or electronic entry evidencing such shares) will be determined by the Company.\\n(b) Subject to the satisfaction of any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 of this Agreement) and Section 6(c) of this Agreement, in the event one or more Restricted Stock Units vests, the Company will issue to you, on the applicable vesting date (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter), one share of Common Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit that vests (and for purposes of this Agreement, such issuance date is referred to as the \\\"Original Issuance Date\\\"); provided, however, that the Original Issuance Date will in all cases occur no later than the Issuance Deadline. For purposes of this Agreement, the \\\"Issuance Deadline\\\" means the latest of the following, as applicable: (i) December 31 of the calendar year in which the applicable vesting date occurs (that is, the last day of your taxable year in which the applicable vesting date occurs); (ii) if permitted in a manner that complies with Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), the last day of the period set forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4)(i)(A); or (iii) any date that is permitted without incurring adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code.\",\n",

Specified foreign property, including Restricted Stock Units, shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan and other rights to receive shares (e.g., options) of a non-Canadian company, held by a Canadian resident must generally be reported annually on a Form T1135 (Foreign Income Verification Statement) if the total cost of the specified foreign property exceeds C\\\\$100,000 at any time during the year. Restricted Stock Units must be reported - generally at a nil cost - if the C\\\\$100,000 cost threshold is exceeded because other specified foreign property is held by you. When shares of Common Stock are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base (\\\"ACB\\\") of the shares.

This Award is granted to you effective as of the date of grant set forth in the Grant Notice (the \\\"Date of Grant\\\").

The Award represents the right to be issued on a future date one share of Common Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit that vests under this Award, subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Agreement and in the Plan. As of the Date of Grant, the Company will credit to a bookkeeping account maintained by the Company for your benefit (the \\\"Account\\\") the number of Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award.

Vesting.\\n\\n(a) Subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, your Award will vest, if at all, in accordance with the vesting schedule provided in the Grant Notice, including any special acceleration provisions, as applicable, contained in the Grant Notice.\\n(b) Vesting will cease upon the termination of your Continuous Service, except if such termination is due to your death, in which case vesting will accelerate as described in the Grant Notice (and subject to any other acceleration provided for in the Grant Notice or the Plan). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, if vesting accelerates as a result of the termination of your Continuous Service due to your death, such acceleration will occur on the date of your death (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter); provided, however, that: (i) such acceleration may be delayed until the date the Company receives written notification of your death from the executor or administrator of your estate (or your beneficiary, if applicable); (ii) the Company may require the executor or administrator of your estate (or your beneficiary, if applicable) to provide certain information to the Company (including, but not limited to, tax-related information), to the extent permissible under applicable law; and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any shares of Common Stock that are issuable as a result of such acceleration will be issued no later than the Issuance Deadline (as defined in Section 6(b) of this Agreement).\\n(c) On the termination of your Continuous Service (for any reason other than death), the Restricted Stock Units credited to the Account that were not vested on the date of such termination (and are not accelerated pursuant to any acceleration provided for in the Grant Notice or the Plan) will be forfeited and returned to the Company at no cost to the Company and you will have no further right, title or interest in or to such Restricted Stock Units or the underlying shares of Common Stock.

The Board will round down, to the nearest whole share or whole unit of rights, any fractional shares or rights for fractional shares.\\n4. Compliance with Law. You will not be issued any shares under your Award unless either (a) the shares are registered under the Securities Act; or (b) the Company has determined that such issuance would be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Your Award also must comply with other applicable laws and regulations governing the Award, including any U.S. and non-U.S. state, federal and local laws, and you will not receive such shares if the Company determines that such receipt would not be in material compliance with such laws and regulations.\\n5.

The January 28, 2024 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position, have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period.

       "\n",
       "The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories and product purchase commitments, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, property, plant, and equipment, and other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.\n",

The standard is effective for our annual reporting starting with fiscal year 2025 and for interim period reporting starting in fiscal year 2026 retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",

The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied prospectively, with retrospective application permitted. We expect to adopt this standard in our annual reporting starting with fiscal year 2026. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",

       "The plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2020. The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA's motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court's dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in dismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA's petition for rehearing en banc of the Ninth Circuit panel's majority decision to reverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed on October 10, 2023. On November 21, 2023, NVIDIA filed a motion with the Ninth Circuit for a stay of the mandate pending NVIDIA's petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court's resolution of the matter. On December 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted NVIDIA's motion to stay the mandate. NVIDIA filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on March 4, 2024. Four amicus briefs in support of NVIDIA's petition were filed on April 5, 2024.\n",

       "\n",
       "NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications. Our two operating segments are \"Compute \\& Networking\" and \"Graphics,\" as described in Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n",

       "## Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\n",
       "\n",
       "## Demand and Supply, Product Transitions, and New Products and Business Models\n",
       "\n",
       "Our overall revenue, driven by data center compute, continued to grow through the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. We continue to gather customer demand indications across several product transitions. We have demand visibility for our data center products, including the recently announced Blackwell GPU architecture. We have previously increased our supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers with planned receipts later this year. We continue to add new vendors and have entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products. The increased purchase volumes and number of suppliers and integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. Our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 continued to be impacted by shortening lead times for certain components. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines. While supply for H100 continued to improve, we are still constrained on H200. Our next generation data center architecture, Blackwell, is in production, and we plan on shipping customer samples in the second quarter. We expect to ramp customer shipments of Blackwell in the second half of the fiscal year. We believe the initial demand for Blackwell is well ahead of the projected supply for this fiscal year. We expect supply constraints for our Blackwell offerings will continue into next year.\n",
       "\n",
       "Product transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center, Gaming, and Professional Visualization products. We have begun a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of\n",
       "\n",
       "AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can reduce or create volatility in our revenue. The increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in product delays. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs.\n",
       "\n",
       "We build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications such as our NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, our Omniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies, such as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term trajectory is unknown.\n",

       "# Global Trade \n",
       "\n",
       "In August 2022, the U.S. government, or the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\n",
       "\n",
       "In July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\n",
       "\n",
       "In October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products. We have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.\n",
       "\n",
       "We expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. We ramped new products designed specifically for China that do not require an export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China is down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of new export control restrictions in October 2023. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license, or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all.\n",
       "\n",
       "Our competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed in the long term, if there are further changes in the USG's export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East.\n",
       "\n",
       "While we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for a discussion of this potential impact.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Macroeconomic Factors\n",
       "\n",
       "Macroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints and global economic and geopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and quantify, these macroeconomic factors can also impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our investments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors.\n",
       "\n",
       "# Israel and Hamas Conflict \n",
       "\n",
       "We are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our approximately 4,000 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Our global supply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact. A substantial number of our employees in the region have been called-up for active military duty in Israel. Some of our employees in Israel have been on active military duty for an extended period and they or others may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. We have not experienced significant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is further extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our business.\n",

While we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into longterm supply agreements and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. Additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are not available from third parties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on orders for certain supply may be extended. We have previously experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scale their capabilities to meet our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity, which may require additional deposits. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines.\n",

       "Our overall revenue, driven by data center compute, continued to grow through the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. We continue to gather customer demand indications across several product transitions. We have demand visibility for our data center products, including the recently announced Blackwell GPU architecture. We have previously increased our supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers with planned receipts later this year. We continue to add new vendors and have entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products. The increased purchase volumes and number of suppliers and integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. Our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 continued to be impacted by shortening lead times for certain components. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines. While supply for H100 continued to improve, we are still constrained on H200. Our next generation data center architecture, Blackwell, is in production, and we plan on shipping customer samples in the second quarter. We expect to ramp customer shipments of Blackwell in the second half of the fiscal year. We believe the initial demand for Blackwell is well ahead of the projected supply for this fiscal year. We expect supply constraints for our Blackwell offerings will continue into next year.\n",
       "\n",
       "Our customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in the past. Product transitions are complex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center, Gaming, and Professional Visualization products. We have begun a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to long manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can reduce or create volatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. The increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in product delays. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs.\n",
       "\n",
       "Many end customers often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by our multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to accurately forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties.\n",
       "\n",
       "If we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. If our contract manufacturers experience supply constraints, we may not be able to increase supply to meet customer demand in a timely manner, or at all. If we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally, since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact.\n",
       "\n",
       "If we overestimate our customers' future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers' increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future. We have also written down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments and may have to do so in the future. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\n",
       "\n",
       "We build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications, such as NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, NVIDIA AI Foundations, Omniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies, such as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our products may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand. Additionally, we started shipping our CPU product offerings, the Grace CPU and Grace Hopper Superchips, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our inability to accurately predict our CPU demand may create volatility in our revenue or supply levels.\n",
       "\n",
       "Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.\n",
       "\n",
       "The use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0 merge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased aftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized \"gray market,\" which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels.\n",

       "Additionally, we depend on developers, customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW. Failure by developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our platforms, or failure by third-party content providers or publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adversely affect customer demand.\n",

       "We sell our products internationally, and we also have operations and conduct business internationally. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States, and we generated $48 \\%$ of our revenue during the first quarter in fiscal year 2025 from sales outside the United States. We have not received licenses from the USG to ship restricted products to China. We ramped new products designed specifically for China that do not require an export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China is down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of new export control restrictions in October 2023. We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These include domestic and international economic and political conditions in countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do business, government lockdowns to control case spread of global or local health issues, differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices, different domestic and international business and cultural practices, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies, currency fluctuations, natural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues and other catastrophic events.\n",
       "\n",
       "We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales to customers who purchase directly or indirectly from us, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\n",
       "\n",
       "We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. Sales to one direct customer, Customer A, and sales to another direct customer, Customer B, represented $13 \\%$ and $11 \\%$ of total revenue, respectively, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Both were attributable to the Compute \\& Networking segment. With several of these channel partners, we are selling multiple products and systems in our portfolio through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners' or customers' purchasing patterns. Many of our customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors and other channel partners. Two indirect customers each represented $10 \\%$ or more of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025; one of these indirect customers purchased our products primarily through direct Customer B. Both were attributable to the Compute \\& Networking segment. If end demand increases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amount of our revenue. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries' trade restrictions or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations.\n",
       "\n",
       "Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other actions may adversely impact our business.\n",
       "\n",
       "We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea and China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us regarding our business and competition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also received requests for information from regulators in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and China regarding our sales of GPUs, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, and we expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Governments and regulators are considering imposing restrictions on the hardware, software, and systems used to develop frontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act will likely become law this year. Restrictions under this and any other regulations, if implemented, could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of new systems using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\n",
       "\n",
       "Government actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce's U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\n",
       "\n",
       "For example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.\n",
       "\n",
       "The increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings.\n",
       "\n",
       "Concerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications, models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying, tuning, and deploying LLMs. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our business and financial results.\n",
       "\n",
       "Such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI technologies. As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of export control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral controls restricting GPUs and associated\n",
       "\n",
       "products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be further lightened, would further restrict our ability to export our technology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair, or transfer of our products, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and customers to provide services to their end customers, even outside China.\n",
       "\n",
       "Export controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside China and for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business.\n",
       "\n",
       "Increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges. Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our sales and efforts to supply the China market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. If the regulators conclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to various penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\n",
       "\n",
       "During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China's semiconductor and supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop, produce and manufacture certain chips to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in China. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\n",
       "\n",
       "In October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products. We have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.\n",
       "\n",
       "Following these export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out of China and Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer. However, the licensing process is time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is offered, it may impose burdensome conditions that we or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG is evaluating license requests in a closed process that does not have clear standards or an opportunity for review. For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or \"NAC,\" process has not resulted in approvals for exports of products to customers in China. The license process for exports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions for countries outside China. The requirements have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and already have disadvantaged and may in the future\n",
       "\n",
       "disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.\n",
       "\n",
       "Management of these new licenses and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if there are further changes in the USG's export controls, including further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USG has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, or by requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that would disable or impair GPUs if certain system or use conditions are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. In addition, as the performance of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export controls may have a greater impact on our ability to compete in markets subject to those controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions to \"design-out\" certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve markets worldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in other markets, such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls.\n",
       "\n",
       "Additionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.\n",
       "\n",
       "Finally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan. Any new restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan, would negatively impact our business and financial results.\n",

       "\n",
       "Pursuant to the Global Restricted Stock Unit Grant Notice (\"Grant Notice\") and this Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (including any additional terms and conditions for your country set forth in the appendix attached hereto (the \"Appendix\")) (collectively, the \"Agreement\"), NVIDIA Corporation (the \"Company\") has awarded you a Restricted Stock Unit Award (the \"Award\") under its Amended \\& Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"Plan\"). This Award is granted to you effective as of the date of grant set forth in the Grant Notice (the \"Date of Grant\"). Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Agreement will have the same meanings given to them in the Plan.\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Grant of the Award. The Award represents the right to be issued on a future date one share of Common Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit that vests under this Award, subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Agreement and in the Plan. As of the Date of Grant, the Company will credit to a bookkeeping account maintained by the Company for your benefit (the \"Account\") the number of Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you will not be required to make any payment to the Company with respect to your receipt of the Award, the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units or the delivery of the underlying Common Stock.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 2. Vesting.\n",
       "\n",
       "(a) Subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, your Award will vest, if at all, in accordance with the vesting schedule provided in the Grant Notice, including any special acceleration provisions, as applicable, contained in the Grant Notice.\n",
       "(b) Vesting will cease upon the termination of your Continuous Service, except if such termination is due to your death, in which case vesting will accelerate as described in the Grant Notice (and subject to any other acceleration provided for in the Grant Notice or the Plan). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, if vesting accelerates as a result of the termination of your Continuous Service due to your death, such acceleration will occur on the date of your death (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter); provided, however, that: (i) such acceleration may be delayed until the date the Company receives written notification of your death from the executor or administrator of your estate (or your beneficiary, if applicable); (ii) the Company may require the executor or administrator of your estate (or your beneficiary, if applicable) to provide certain information to the Company (including, but not limited to, tax-related information), to the extent permissible under applicable law; and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any shares of Common Stock that are issuable as a result of such acceleration will be issued no later than the Issuance Deadline (as defined in Section 6(b) of this Agreement).\n",
       "(c) On the termination of your Continuous Service (for any reason other than death), the Restricted Stock Units credited to the Account that were not vested on the date of such termination (and are not accelerated pursuant to any acceleration provided for in the Grant Notice or the Plan) will be forfeited and returned to the Company at no cost to the Company and you will have no further right, title or interest in or to such Restricted Stock Units or the underlying shares of Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, Continuous Service during only a period prior to a vesting date (but where Continuous Service has terminated prior to the vesting date) does not entitle you to vest in a pro-rata portion of the Restricted Stock Units on such date.\n",
       "\n",
       "# 3. Number of Restricted Stock Units and Shares of Common Stock. \n",
       "\n",
       "(a) The number of Restricted Stock Units (and the related shares of Common Stock) subject to your Award will be adjusted from time to time for Capitalization Adjustments, as provided in the Plan.\n",
       "(b) Any Restricted Stock Units, shares, cash or other property that become subject to the Award as a result of a Capitalization Adjustment, if any, will be subject to the same forfeiture restrictions, restrictions on transferability, and time and manner of delivery as applicable to the other shares covered by your Award.\n",
       "(c) No fractional shares or rights for fractional shares of Common Stock will be created by this Section 3. The Board will round down, to the nearest whole share or whole unit of rights, any fractional shares or rights for fractional shares.\n",
       "4. Compliance with Law. You will not be issued any shares under your Award unless either (a) the shares are registered under the Securities Act; or (b) the Company has determined that such issuance would be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Your Award also must comply with other applicable laws and regulations governing the Award, including any U.S. and non-U.S. state, federal and local laws, and you will not receive such shares if the Company determines that such receipt would not be in material compliance with such laws and regulations.\n",
       "5. Limitations on Transfer. Your Award is not transferable, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. In addition to any other limitation on transfer created by applicable securities or other laws, you agree not to assign, hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in any of the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award until the shares are issued to you. After the shares have been issued to you, you are free to assign, hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in such shares, provided that any such actions are in compliance with the provisions in this Agreement and applicable securities or other laws. If permitted by the Board and valid under applicable law, you may, by delivering written notice to the Company's designated broker, pursuant to a form provided by such broker, designate a third party who, in the event of your death, will thereafter be entitled to receive any distribution of Common Stock to which you were entitled at the time of your death pursuant to this Agreement.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 6. Date of Issuance.\n",
       "\n",
       "(a) The issuance of shares of Common Stock in respect of the Restricted Stock Units is intended to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and will be construed and administered in such a manner to the extent applicable. The form of such issuance (e.g., a stock certificate or electronic entry evidencing such shares) will be determined by the Company.\n",
       "(b) Subject to the satisfaction of any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 of this Agreement) and Section 6(c) of this Agreement, in the event one or more Restricted Stock Units vests, the Company will issue to you, on the applicable vesting date (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter), one share of Common Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit that vests (and for purposes of this Agreement, such issuance date is referred to as the \"Original Issuance Date\"); provided, however, that the Original Issuance Date will in all cases occur no later than the Issuance Deadline. For purposes of this Agreement, the \"Issuance Deadline\" means the latest of the following, as applicable: (i) December 31 of the calendar year in which the applicable vesting date occurs (that is, the last day of your taxable year in which the applicable vesting date occurs); (ii) if permitted in a manner that complies with Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), the last day of the period set forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4)(i)(A); or (iii) any date that is permitted without incurring adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code.\n",
       "\n",
       "(c) If (i) this Award is subject to any withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 below) on the Original Issuance Date, (ii) the Original Issuance Date does not occur (1) during an \"open window period\" applicable to you, as determined by the Company in accordance with the Company's then-effective policy on trading in Company securities, or (2) on a date when you are otherwise permitted to sell shares of Common Stock on an established stock exchange or stock market (including but not limited to under a previously established Company-approved 10b5-1 trading plan), and (iii) the Company elects, prior to the Original Issuance Date, (1) not to satisfy any withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 below) by withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares otherwise due, on the Original Issuance Date, to you under this Award, (2) not to permit you to enter into a \"same day sale\" commitment with a broker-dealer pursuant to this Agreement (including but not limited to a commitment under a previously established Company-approved 10b5-1 trading plan) and (3) not to permit you to cover any withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 below) in cash, then the shares that would otherwise be issued to you on the Original Issuance Date will not be issued on such Original Issuance Date and will instead be issued on the first business day when you are not prohibited from selling shares of Common Stock on an established stock exchange or stock market or on such other date determined by the Company, but in no event later than the Issuance Deadline.\n",
       "7. Dividends. You will receive no benefit or adjustment to your Award and any unissued shares thereunder with respect to any cash dividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result from a Capitalization Adjustment. Following the date of vesting, in the event of any cash dividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result from a Capitalization Adjustment, no cash, stock or other property related to such dividend or distribution will be issuable in respect of your vested Restricted Stock Units.\n",
       "8. Restrictive Legends. The shares of Common Stock issued under your Award will be endorsed with appropriate legends if determined by the Company that legends are required under applicable law or otherwise.\n",
       "\n",
       "# 9. Award not a Service Contract. \n",
       "\n",
       "(a) Your Continuous Service with the Company or, if different, the Affiliate that employs you or for which you otherwise render services (the \"Service Recipient\") is not for any specified term and, if permitted under applicable law, may be terminated by you or by the Service Recipient at any time, for any reason, with or without cause and with or without notice. Nothing in this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the vesting of your Award pursuant to the schedule set forth in the Grant Notice or the issuance of the shares subject to your Award), the Plan or any covenant of good faith and fair dealing that may be found implicit in this Agreement or the Plan will: (i) confer upon you any right to continue in the employ of, or continue an affiliation or other service relationship with the Service Recipient; (ii) constitute any promise or commitment by the Company, the Service Recipient or any other Affiliate regarding the fact or nature of future positions, future work assignments, future compensation or any other term or condition of employment or affiliation; (iii) confer any right or benefit under this Agreement or the Plan unless such right or benefit has specifically accrued under the terms of this Agreement or Plan; or (iv) deprive the Service Recipient of the right to terminate you at any time and without regard to any future vesting opportunity that you may have. The grant of the Award shall not be interpreted as forming or amending an employment or service contract with the Company or the Service Recipient.\n",
       "(b) By accepting this Award, you acknowledge and agree that the right to continue vesting in the Award is earned only through Continuous Service (not through the act of being hired, being granted this Award or any other award or benefit) and that the Company has the right to reorganize, sell, spin-out or otherwise restructure one or more of its businesses or Affiliates at any time or from time to time, as it deems appropriate (a \"reorganization\"). You further acknowledge and agree that such a reorganization could result in the termination of your Continuous Service, or\n",
       "\n",
       "the termination of Affiliate status of the Service Recipient and the loss of benefits available to you under this Agreement, including but not limited to, the termination of the right to continue vesting in the Award. You further acknowledge and agree that this Agreement, the Plan, the transactions contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth in this Agreement or any covenant of good faith and fair dealing that may be found implicit in any of them do not constitute an express or implied promise of continued engagement as an Employee or Consultant for the term of this Agreement, for any period, or at all, and will not interfere in any way with your right or the right of the Service Recipient to terminate your Continuous Service at any time, with or without cause and, if permitted under applicable law, with or without notice, and will not interfere in any way with the Company's right to conduct a reorganization.\n",
       "\n",
       "# 10. Responsibility for Taxes. \n",
       "\n",
       "(a) You acknowledge that, regardless of any action the Company or the Service Recipient takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefit tax, payment on account or other tax related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you or deemed by the Company or the Service Recipient, in its discretion, to be an appropriate charge to you even if legally applicable to the Company or the Service Recipient (\"Tax-Related Items\"), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Service Recipient, if any. You further acknowledge that the Company and/or the Service Recipient (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of your Restricted Stock Units or the underlying shares of Common Stock, including, but not limited to, the grant of the Restricted Stock Units, the vesting and settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the delivery or sale of any shares of Common Stock and the issuance of any dividends, and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of your Award to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. You acknowledge and agree that you will not make any claim against the Company, or any of its Officers, Directors, Employees or Affiliates (including the Service Recipient) for Tax-Related Items arising from your Award. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that the Company and/or the Service Recipient may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.\n",
       "(b) In connection with the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements satisfactorily to the Company and/or the Service Recipient to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Service Recipient, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations or rights, if any, with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following: (i) withholding from your wages or any other cash compensation otherwise payable to you; (ii) causing you to tender a cash payment or requiring you to make a payment in another form acceptable to the Company; (iii) permitting or requiring you to enter into a \"same day sale\" commitment with a broker-dealer that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (a \"FINRA Dealer\") (if required, pursuant to this authorization and without further consent) whereby you irrevocably elect to sell a portion of the shares to be delivered upon settlement of your Restricted Stock Units to satisfy the Tax-Related Items and whereby the FINRA Dealer irrevocably commits to forward the proceeds necessary to satisfy the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items directly to the Company and/or the Service Recipient, including a commitment pursuant to a previously established Company-approved 10b5-1 plan; (iv) withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock issued or otherwise issuable to you upon settlement of the Award with a value equal to the amount of such withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items or such other amount as may be permitted while still avoiding classification of the Award as a liability for financial accounting purposes; provided, however, that if you are an Officer, then the Company will withhold a number of shares of Common Stock upon the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, unless the use of such withholding method is not feasible under applicable law or has materially adverse accounting\n",
       "\n",
       "consequences, as determined by the Board, in its sole discretion, in which case, any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items may be satisfied by one or a combination of methods (i)-(iii) above; and/or (v) any other method of withholding determined by the Company, provided such method is compliant with applicable law and the Plan.\n",
       "(c) The Company and/or the Service Recipient may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory or other withholding rates, including maximum rates applicable in your jurisdiction(s). In the event of over-withholding, you may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash from the Company or the Service Recipient (with no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent), or if not refunded, you may seek a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, you may be required to pay any Tax-Related Items directly to the applicable tax authority or to the Company and/or the Service Recipient. Maximum tax rates are based on the applicable rates in your country, including your share of payroll or similar taxes, as provided in tax law, regulations, or the tax authority's administrative practices, not to exceed the highest rate in that jurisdiction, even if that rate exceeds the highest rate that may be applicable to you. If any withholding obligation for TaxRelated Items is satisfied by withholding a number of shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, you will be deemed to have been issued the full number of shares of Common Stock subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the shares of Common Stock is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.\n",
       "(d) Unless any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied, the Company will have no obligation to deliver to you any shares of Common Stock or other consideration pursuant to this Award.\n",
       "(e) In the event any obligation to withhold arises prior to the delivery to you of shares of Common Stock or it is determined after the delivery of shares of Common Stock to you that the amount of the withholding obligation was greater than the amount withheld, if anything, you agree to indemnify and hold the Company and/or the Service Recipient harmless from any failure by the Company and/or the Service Recipient to withhold the proper amount.\n",
       "11. Nature of Grant. By accepting your Award, you acknowledge, understand and agree that:\n",
       "(a) the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, to the extent permitted by the Plan;\n",
       "(b) the Award is exceptional, voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future Awards (whether on the same or different terms), or benefits in lieu of an Award, even if an Award has been granted in the past;\n",
       "(c) all decisions with respect to future Awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;\n",

       "(k) unless otherwise provided herein, in the Plan or by the Company in its discretion, the Award and the benefits evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Award or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company nor to be exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the shares of Common Stock;\n",
       "(1) unless otherwise agreed with the Company in writing, the Award and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award, and the income from and value of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, the service you may provide as a director of an Affiliate; and\n",
       "(m) if you are in Continuous Service outside the United States:\n",

       "12. No Advice Regarding Grant. The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding your participation in the Plan, or your acquisition or sale of the underlying shares of Common Stock. You should consult with your own personal tax, financial and/or legal advisors regarding your participation in the Plan, and by accepting this Award, you have agreed that you have done so or knowingly and voluntarily declined to do so.\n",
       "13. Unsecured Obligation. Your Award is unfunded, and as a holder of an Award, you will be considered an unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to the Company's obligation, if any, to issue shares pursuant to this Agreement upon vesting of the Award. You will not have voting or\n",
       "\n",
       "any other rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to the shares to be issued pursuant to this Agreement until such shares are issued to you. Upon such issuance, you will obtain full voting and other rights as a stockholder of the Company. Nothing contained in this Agreement, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, will create or be construed to create a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between you and the Company or any other person.\n",

You hereby acknowledge receipt or the right to receive a document providing the information required by Rule 428(b)(1) promulgated under the Securities Act, which includes the Plan prospectus.

Furthermore, you could be prohibited from (i) disclosing the inside information to any third party, which may include fellow employees and (ii) \"tipping\" third parties or causing them otherwise to buy or sell securities.

If it is determined that the Award is deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A and you are a \"specified employee\" (as determined under Code Section 409A) on your \"separation from service\" (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h), without regard to any alternative definitions therein, a \"Separation from Service\"), then the issuance of any shares, cash or other property that would otherwise be made on the date of your Separation from Service (or within the first six months thereafter as a result of your Separation from Service) will not be made on the originally scheduled date(s) and will instead be issued in a lump sum on the earlier of (i) the date that is six months and one day after the date of the Separation from Service or (ii) the date of your death, but if and only if such delay in the issuance is necessary to avoid the imposition of taxation on you in respect of the shares, cash or property under Code Section 409A.\n",
